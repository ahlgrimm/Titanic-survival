In this project, I am using different machine learning methods to predict the survival status of passengers who were on the Titanic, which sank in 1912. A comparative analysis of the performance of Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors is performed. 
I identify the best performing method (Random Forest) and trace its predictive gains to its allowance of nonlinear predictor interactions that are missed by other methods. Moreover, I find that the passengerâ€™s age, sex, title, class and the paid fare are the most important variables to predict the survival status using the variable importance function provided by the Random Forest method.
